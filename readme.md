I, Elise, am the only contributor to this project

## Timing

I've started with this exercise on Friday 29th March 2019. It's part of a series of exercises on Javascript during my educational training at BeCode, which lasts till the 6th of September.

## What is it?

The goal of this exercise is to make Javascript interact with the static opening hours, to display if a shop is currently open or not. Next to that, there should be a function for the owner to close the shop early.
